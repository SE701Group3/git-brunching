# Contributing Guidelines

We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## Pull Requests

Please ensure these points are followed during PR:

- Ensure a clean commit history - make one commit per feature and squash fixes
- Ensure a descriptive pull request - make sure to include relevant links, and relationships between the issue/feature you are doing
- Ensure two or more PR review assignees
- Do not accept your own pull request - after the PR review either the PR reviewees or admin will squash and merge your PR
- Change only relevant files - try to focus on your issue feature and nothing else. This will help avoid conflicts in the future
- Create unit tests for your feature changes, and ensure that all tests pass

## Report bugs using Github's [issues](https://github.com/SE701Group3/restaurant-manager/issues)

We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](); it's that easy! Please write bug reports with detail - how to reproduce the bug, expected behavior vs actual behavior, sample code, and background context.

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can. [Example SO sample](http://stackoverflow.com/q/12488905/180626)
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)
